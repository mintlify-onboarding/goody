In contrast to API keys (which can be created by anyone in the organization and are scoped to users), you must be an organization admin to set up and manage webhooks since they fire on every order and order batch in the organization.

## Set up webhooks

To set up webhooks, go to **Organization** on the top right, then **Automation API** in the sub-menu, or click the link for your environment:

| Environment    | Webhooks Link                                                |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Production** | https://www.ongoody.com/plus/organization/api/automation     |
| **Sandbox**    | https://sandbox.ongoody.com/plus/organization/api/automation |

## Available webhooks

| Environment                  | Webhooks Link                                                                                                            |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `order_batch.created`        | When an order batch is newly created. The order batch could still be in process of sending, or scheduled for the future. |
| `order_batch.completed`      | When an order batch is fully processed and all orders have been created.                                                 |
| `order.created`              | When an order is created and is ready to be opened.                                                                      |
| `order.gift_opened`          | When a gift is opened by the recipient.                                                                                  |
| `order.gift_accepted`        | When a gift has been accepted by the recipient.                                                                          |
| `order.thank_you_note_added` | When a recipient adds a thank you note to a order after accepting it.                                                    |
| `order.shipped`              | When an order starts shipping. If there are multiple shipments, this is called for the first.                            |
| `order.delivered`            | When an order is fully delivered. If there are multiple shipments, this is called when all shipments are delivered.      |

## Setting up a new webhook

![](/images/new-webhooks.png)

Enter a URL to recieve webhooks in the **Endpoint URL** section.

You can leave **Message Filtering** blank to receive all events, or select specific events to receive.

## Webhook security

To ensure the integrity of the webhooks you receive, we recommend verifying the signatures of the webhooks you receive. Svix provides packages for multiple languages that make verifying signatures easy.

To see how, go to the Webhook Security page.

## Logs

You can view the logs for webhook delivery for each endpoint, and re-send any failed webhooks if needed.
