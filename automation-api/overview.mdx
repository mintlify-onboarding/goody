description: "Goody for Business customers can use the Automation API to automate their gifting and sending. With the Automation API, you can programmatically create one-to-one or one-to-many gifts, retrieve information about orders, and get real-time webhook notifications on order events."

Some things you can build with the Automation API:

- **Trigger sending gifts on events in your CRM, HRIS, or another application.** Send a customer gift for client anniversaries, deals closed, and more.
- **Send Goody order information to other applications.** Trigger Slack messages on gift accepts, add tasks in your CRM when gifts are delivered, save order totals to a spreadsheet, and more.
