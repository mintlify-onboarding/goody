## Production and sandbox environments

Goody's API has two environments:

- **Production**: https://api.ongoody.com
- **Sandbox**: https://sandbox.api.ongoody.com

## Start using the API

To start using the API, sign up for a Goody for Business account at https://www.ongoody.com/business. It's free to sign up.

To obtain an API key for the Automation API, go to your Account page and click [API Keys](https://www.ongoody.com/plus/account/api-keys). To send gifts in production, you'll need to add a payment method, which you can do on that page. To obtain an API key for the Commerce API, refer to the [getting started guide](commerce-api/overview).

## Using the Sandbox environments

You can use the Sandbox environment to send test gifts without being charged for them. Your sandbox account is entirely separate account from production, so you can do your testing without affecting your main account.

Visit https://sandbox.ongoody.com/business to sign up for a sandbox account, and to obtain an API key for the Automation API, go to your Account page and click API Keys. To obtain an [API key](https://www.ongoody.com/plus/account/api-keys) for the Commerce API, refer to the [getting started guide](commerce-api/overview).
