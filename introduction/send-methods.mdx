## Gift – Email Notification

Send method: `email_and_link`

Orders will be created as gifts. An email notification (and text message, if phone is specified) will be sent to the recipient of the gift. You will also be able to retrieve the gift link from the `individual_gift_link` field on the `Order` object (hence "email and link"). An email must be specified for every recipient.

Gift recipients can view their gift, swap for another gift (if swap is not disabled), and accept the gift by entering their address.

## Gift - Links Only

Send method: `link_multiple_custom_list`

Orders will be created as gifts. No email notification will be sent to the gift recipient. On the `Order` object, there will be an `individual_gift_link` field which contains the link to the gift, which you can send to the recipient.

Gift recipients can view their gift, swap for another gift (if swap is not disabled), and accept the gift by entering their address.

## Direct Mail

    "last_name": "Kenter",

    }
  }
