## Orders

The status for an order can be found on the `status` field.

| Status            | Meaning                                                                                                                                                                                |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `created`         | The gift has been created.                                                                                                                                                             |
| `notified`        | Notifications (e.g. email or text) have been sent for this order, if requested. If no notifications are requested, orders will still move to this state without sending notifications. |
| `opened`          | For gift orders: the recipient has opened a gift.                                                                                                                                      |
| `accepted`        | For gift orders: the recipient has accepted the gift. For other orders: the order has been accepted for processing.                                                                    |
| `pending_payment` | The order is awaiting payment. If a payment method has been specified, it will be processed at this stage.                                                                             |
| `paid`            | The order has been paid for and is being prepared for shipment.                                                                                                                        |
| `shipped`         | The order has shipped. If the order has multiple shipments, it will enter this state when the first shipment starts moving.                                                            |
| `delivered`       | The order has been delivered. If the order has multiple shipments, it will enter this state when all shipments have been delivered.                                                    |

## Order batches

Order batches are collections of orders. The order batch's `send_status` displays the status of the order batch.

| Status     | Meaning                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `pending`  | For non-scheduled order batches, the order batch is being processed to create orders for each recipient. For scheduled order batches, the order batch is waiting for the scheduled time to send. |
| `complete` | The order batch has been created and all orders have been created for all recipients.                                                                                                            |

## Testing shipped and delivered statuses

In the sandbox only, we provide some _magic words_ for testing `shipped` and `delivered` orders. When you enter a specific from name, the order will be moved to shipped or delivered after it's accepted. Here's how to use it:

1. Create the order batch with `from_name` set to `[shipped]` or `[delivered]`.
2. Open the gift link and accept the gift.
3. Shortly after the gift is accepted, the order will move to Shipped or Delivered, depending on the magic word you use.
