sidebarTitle: "order_batch.created"
description: "Emitted when a order batch is created in the organization."
---

**For non-scheduled order batches,** for order batches with 10 or fewer recipients, the `order_batch.created` event will contain all of the orders for each recipient. For order batches with more than 10 recipients, order creation happens asynchronously, and the `order_batch.completed` event is emitted immediately after the orders are created.

**For scheduled order batches,** no order will be created when the order batch is created until the scheduled send time. The `order_batch.completed` event is emitted when the order batch scheduled time is reached, and orders are created for the order batch.

## Schema

<ParamField query="event_type" type="string" required>
  The type of event that occurred
</ParamField>
<ParamField query="event_id" type="string" required>
  The unique ID for this event
</ParamField>
<ResponseField name="data" type="object">
  An order batch is the primary resource created by the API. Order batches
  contain an array of orders.
  <Expandable title="properties">
    <ResponseField name="id" type="string<uuid>" required></ResponseField>
    <ResponseField name="send_status" type="string" required>
      The `pending` status indicates that an order batch is being prepared to be
      sent out. If it is not scheduled, it is being sent asynchronously. If it
      is scheduled, it will stay in `pending` state until the scheduled time is
      reached, at which point it will be processed and moved to `complete`. When
      it is in `pending` status, no orders are created yet. When the order batch
      is in `complete` status, all orders are created and available. Allowed
      values: `pending` `complete` `failed` `canceled`
    </ResponseField>
    <ResponseField name="from_name" type="string" required>
      The name of the sender. This is displayed on the order and notifications.
    </ResponseField>
    <ResponseField name="message" type="string">
      The message in this order batch, provided by the sender.
    </ResponseField>
    <ResponseField name="orders_count" type="integer" required>
      The total number of orders in this order batch. This might be blank if the
      order batch is scheduled for the future, or it could be fewer than the
      recipient count if the order batch is in the process of being sent.
    </ResponseField>
    <ResponseField name="orders_preview" type="array[object]" required>
      A preview of the first 10 orders in this order batch. To paginate through
      all of the orders, use the `/order_batches/:id/orders` endpoint with
      `?page&per_page`. If your use case never sends more than 10 orders in a
      single batch, you can use this field instead of calling
      `/order_batches/:id/orders`. For order batches with more than 10
      recipients, this array will be empty while the orders are asynchronously
      created in the background.

        <ResponseField name="individual_gift_link" type="string" required>
          This gift link can be sent to the recipient or shared with the sender.
          For privacy reasons, this gift link does not display tracking
          information. A separate link, the recipient link, is sent directly to
          the recipient after they accept their gift, which does contain
          tracking information.
        </ResponseField>
        <ResponseField name="cart" type="object" required>
          The cart currently on this order. If the order is a gift that was
          swapped, `cart` displays the most recent products selected (i.e.
          post-swap).
