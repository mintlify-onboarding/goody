sidebarTitle: "order.shipped"
description: "Emitted when the order is shipped. If there are multiple shipments, this is emitted when the first shipment for this order is in transit."

You can access the list of shipments under the `shipments` field. Note that for multi-shipment orders, when this order first enters the shipped state, the list of shipments might be incomplete since more shipments might be shipped later.
