## Get order

In most cases, you'll want to get information about an individual order. You can retrieve an order by calling the [GET /orders/:id](/api-reference/orders/retrieve-an-order) endpoint.

This will return all information about the order, in particular its status, such as `notified`, `opened`, `shipped`, `delivered`, etc. For more information on all of the available order statuses, visit the [Order Lifecycle](/introduction/order-lifecycle) documentation page.

For more information about the other fields in the Order object, refer to the [Order schema](/api-reference/schemas/order).

## Cancel order

To cancel an order in `created`, `notified`, or `opened` status, call the [POST /orders/:id/cancel](/api-reference/orders/cancel-an-order) endpoint. For gifts that are in the `accepted` state or later, they are already processing; please contact Goody Support for these orders.

## Get order batch

You can retrieve an order batch by calling the [GET /order_batches/:id](/api-reference/orders/retrieve-an-order) endpoint, or retrieve orders inside the order batch using the [GET /orders/:id/orders](/api-reference/order-batches/retrieve-orders-for-an-order-batch) endpoint.

For more information about the other fields in the OrderBatch object, refer to the [OrderBatch schema](/api-reference/schemas/orderbatch).
