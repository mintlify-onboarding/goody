## Create a Goody for Business account

To sign up for a Goody for Business account in production or sandbox, go to the corresponding link:

| Environment    | API Keys link                               |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| **Production** | https://www.ongoody.com/business/signup     |
| **Sandbox**    | https://sandbox.ongoody.com/business/signup |

## Create a commerce app and API key

Once you're signed up, you'll need to create a commerce app and an API key. Next to your account button on the top right, click the **Organization** link, and then navigate to **Commerce API**.

| Environment    | API Keys link                                              |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Production** | https://www.ongoody.com/plus/organization/api/commerce     |
| **Sandbox**    | https://sandbox.ongoody.com/plus/organization/api/commerce |

Start by setting a name for your commerce app, and click Create. Then, click **New API key** to generate an API key.

## Base URL

The base URL of the API depends on the environment you're using:

| Environment    | Base URL                        |
| -------------- | ------------------------------- |
| **Production** | https://api.ongoody.com         |
| **Sandbox**    | https://api.sandbox.ongoody.com |

## Authentication header

This API uses bearer authentication. Send your API key in the `Authorization` HTTP header preceded by `Bearer `:

```
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_GOODY_COMMERCE_API_KEY
```

## Calling `/me`

To check that you're authenticated, you can send a request to the `/me` endpoint:

```
POST https://api.sandbox.ongoody.com/v1/me
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_GOODY_COMMERCE_API_KEY
```

And it should respond with:

```json
{
  "public_app_id": "YOUR_PUBLIC_APP_ID"
}
```
