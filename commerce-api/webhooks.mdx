## Setting up a new webhook

![](/images/new-webhook-2.png)

Enter a URL to recieve webhooks in the **Endpoint URL** section.

You can leave **Message Filtering** blank to receive all events, or select specific events to receive.

## Webhook security

To ensure the integrity of the webhooks you receive, we recommend verifying the signatures of the webhooks you receive. Svix provides packages for multiple languages that make verifying signatures easy.

To see how, go to the [Webhook Security](/webhooks/webhook-security) page.

## Logs

You can view the logs for webhook delivery for each endpoint, and re-send any failed webhooks if needed.
